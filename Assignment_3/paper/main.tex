\subsection*{1.1a}
Neural network nr.1 can be trained using backpropagation. The input vector is propagated through the network until it reaches the output layer. After that it stops. The other networks don't move forward in each layer, either going backwards or to another neuron in the same layer.

\subsection*{1.1b}
In general an activation function in a neuron must be differentiable to use the backpropagation. It must be propagated through the network layer by layer until it reaches the output layer.
